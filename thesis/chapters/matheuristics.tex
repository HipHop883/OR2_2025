\section{Matheuristics}

In this section, we introduce a class of techniques known as \emph{matheuristics}, which aim to combine the efficiency of heuristic methods with the mathematical models used in the exact methods presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:exact-methods}.

This hybrid approach has proven effective across a wide range of combinatorial problems, often requiring minimal problem-specific adaptation. The term \emph{matheuristics} was originally coined during a workshop held in Bertinoro, Italy, in 2006, to describe the growing number of strategies situated at the intersection between classical optimization and heuristic design.

In the context of the TSP, matheuristics provide a valuable compromise: they allow us to exploit high-quality heuristic solutions while still benefiting from the precision and structure of mathematical models. In the next sections, we will focus on two such strategies: \emph{Hard Fixing} and \emph{Local Branching}.
