In this section, we present and analyze the results obtained from the experiments conducted on the methods introduced in the previous chapters. For each macro category, we developed two algorithms. In the following analysis, we will fine-tune the parameters of each algorithm to identify their optimal configurations. Subsequently, we will compare the best-performing configurations of the two approaches within each category.

\section{Methodology}
Each category will be analyzed saparately and following a specific approach. In general two parameters will be common on all the experiments: the numer of nodes, the time limit and the number of runs. The number of nodes and the time limit will change depending on the methods we're analyzing to fit the specific goals of the experiments, while the number of runs will be fixed to 20 for each configuration tested. In order to ensure statistical significance we will use Performance Profiles to compare the results of the algorithms.
